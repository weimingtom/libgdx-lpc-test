LPC Preparation Project
=======================

About
-----
This repository is just for testing the waters with libGDX before the Liberated Pixel Cup coding competition begins.
Some code, such as the Tileset class, will be re-used for the actual project and thus I want to have that small amount of code publicly accessible.

Projects
--------
rpg          Base project for all shared code. Pretty much the entire game code lives here.
rpg-desktop  Desktop specific code. LWJGL backend.
rpg-android  Android specific code. Game assets for ALL versions live here in the 'assets' directory.
rpg-html     HTML5 specific code.
rpg-packer   Tiled maps and sprite sheets are here. This project uses the TiledMapPacker and TexturePacker to generate the final maps and textures that will be used.

Dependencies
------------
All necessary libraries are included in the libs folder for each project.
Android SDK 2.1 needed for Android version.
GWT needed for HTML5 version.
