LPC Preparation Project
=======================

This repository is just for testing the waters with libGDX before the Liberated Pixel Cup coding competition begins.
Some code, such as the Tileset class, will be re-used for the actual project and thus I want to have that small amount of code publicly accessible.

Contained here are 4 project directories that can be imported into Eclipse.
LWGL is used for the desktop version of the demo.
The Android SDK is needed (of course) to build the Android version.
The HTML5 version does not work as of yet.

All code is licensed under the GPLv3.
All art is licensed under CC-BY-SA.
